ðŸ”§ n8n-MCP Prompts for FlowFront
1. Improve Workflow Analyzer
Using n8n-MCP, analyze the formTrigger node structure and help me improve my workflow-analyzer.ts to better extract form fields from uploaded n8n workflows.
2. Validate Workflow Transformations
Get the webhook node documentation from n8n-MCP and help me fix my workflow transformation logic that converts form triggers to webhook triggers in FlowFront.
3. Find Dashboard Data Points
Using n8n-MCP, search for all nodes that generate metrics or trackable data, then help me identify what dashboard KPIs I can extract from n8n workflows.
ðŸ“š Context7 Prompts for FlowFront

First, use n8n-MCP to get webhook node specifications, then use context7 to build a TypeScript function that creates properly formatted webhook workflows from form trigger data.
2. Debug Workflow Issues
Using n8n-MCP, validate this workflow structure, then use context7 to fix my workflow parsing errors in the FlowFront upload process.
3. Add New Node Support
Use n8n-MCP to research AI nodes that could work with forms, then use context7 to implement support for these nodes in my FlowFront workflow analyzer.
ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

n8n-MCP: Always start with n8n-MCP commands for workflow analysis
Context7: Always end with use context7 for implementation patterns
Combined: Use both when building complete features
